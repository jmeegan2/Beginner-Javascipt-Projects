# Beginner-Javascipt-Projects
So this is a collection of 3 beginner projects for javascript. Im just starting to learn it so I did some
beginner projects to start. The first project displays a monkey emoji with his eyes covered and then once
you click on it it turn to a monkey emoji that has his eyes uncovered. The second project a list of names
and they are in individual blue boxes. The third project was a hover feature that would expand if your 
mouse was over the circle and would go back to original form when cursor was moved off.
